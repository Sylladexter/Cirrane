## Introduction
---
If mind is the logical aspect, then soul is the emotional side. Soul represents the will of humanity. It is said to be the very heart of creation itself. Without the soul, humans can not live and grow. Soul gives way to creative endeavors and helps people reach a deeper understanding about themselves, others, and the world around them.
