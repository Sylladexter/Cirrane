## Introduction
---
Air is a cool breeze on a warm summer day. It’s the heat rising from a bonfire that carries smoke into the sky. Air is a biting cold atop the mountain’s peak. It falls and rises, and never stops moving. Those with an air affinity are thought to be travelers, never staying in one place for long. They wander the earth, experiencing all life has to offer, and go wherever their whim dictates. Air affinities are said to have their head in the clouds, thoughts scattering with the breeze. Don’t be fooled, however, as air affinities can be just as sharp and cutting as a storm’s gale.
