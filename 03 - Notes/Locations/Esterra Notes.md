### Culture
- Food

	- A belief that all things return to the earth and it should be honored
	- Traditional prayer involves incense and candles, they burn sage to cleanse areas such as new homes/businesses/etc. 
#### Memento Mori
- Esterrans have a day where they celebrate the dead
	- Lanterns with letters, prayers and pictures are sent into the sky to be gifted to their departed loved ones.
	- The holiday is always on a the second moon's full moon (idk which month yet)
		- Should be during fall/autumn when the veil between the land of the living and dead is at its thinnest
- Mourning the Dead
	- Private prayers are written on paper and burned so the embers can carry their messages to the dead
	- All things return to earth
		- Esterrans believe that all things return to the earth, the living included. Their funerals are centered around this belief. 
		- When a person dies, their body is returned to the earth from which it came. The body is placed in a bed of flowers where it will remain until moving on to its final resting place. 
		- A family member will be tasked with traveling to the lake to retrieve a Lily of the Moon. The lily is believed to contain the essence of the dead who will help guide their loved one into the afterlife. 
		- After the funeral, the body will be moved to a botanical cemetery (found throughout Esterra) where it will then stay until they have returned to the earth (become compost), at which point the soil will be collected and sent down to the lake to fertilize the Lily of the Moon.
			- Thus the cycle repeats itself!
		
- Keepers of the Lily
	- Organization tasked with maintaining the Lily of the Moon and assisting with its cultivation and growth
	- Keepers of the Lily are exclusively soul affinities, to be chosen as one of them is viewed as a great honor
	- They live at the lake and dedicate their lives to the lily
