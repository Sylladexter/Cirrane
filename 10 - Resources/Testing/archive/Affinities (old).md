# The Elementals


## :LiDroplet: Water

### Introduction
Water, being so tied to life on the planet itself, is often associated with healing properties. It is versatileâ€”able to change its shape to fit the circumstance. That being said, water can be calm and collected like a stream or violent and unpredictable like a storm.

### Deity
*The Kraken* - *Razzle*

The water deity is known for being calm and collected. A storm simmers beneath the surface, and her mysteries remain buried deep. She would prefer to take the path of least resistance, but will not back down from a fight when forced in a corner.
