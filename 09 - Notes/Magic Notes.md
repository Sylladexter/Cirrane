Magic is made up of 3 component:
- Crystals
	- Crystals are found in nature and function as containers for magical elements. They are harvested from the mines of Esterra and shipped off to factories for refinement and to be charged with magical energy for use.
	- They function as the batteries of this universe/act as a magic amplifier
- Runes
	- Crystals can't function without the use of runes. Runes act as the circuitry of crystals and imbue crystals with a given element. 
	- Runes are carved into crystals with attributes/components of an element in order for the crystal to become charged with that element.
		- EX: Fire for fire, water for water, etc.
- Innate Magic
	- All humans (and animals?) are born with innate magic known as an affinity. This allows them to wield magic without the need for crystals/enhancers. Their magic will not be as strong without conduits but they may become stronger through years of studying and honing their abilities. 
		- Animals do have a form of passive magic in regards to the different affinities. Like humans, they are limited to 1 of the 7 elements. Their magic is passive, not active (ex: they can't breath fire, walk on water, etc.).  How this manifests and what it looks like will be handled on a case by case basis and as needed to fit stories. 
	- Affinities have been broken down into tiers as outlined below to denote what a person may or may not be capable of.
		- The use of crystals will bump a person up a tier and allow them to use stronger magic than before.do Tier 1 and 2 abilities, but a Tier 1 can’t do Tier 2 abilities.
