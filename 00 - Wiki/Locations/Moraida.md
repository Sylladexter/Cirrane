### Cafeccino
- *A Place to go when you have a latte on your plate.*

> [[B. Scotti]] loved quiet mornings and a fresh cup of coffee. Migrating from Esterra, B. Scotti wanted to create a home away from home, a safe space for Esterrans migrating to Cirrane. His little cafe would grow and more and more locals gathered to have B. Scotti’s iconic coffee. Now the cafe is inhabited with folks from all different walks of life. Locals sing the praises of [[Cafeccino]], a place to go when you have a latte on your plate.

### Nilla's Ice Creamery 
> A short walk from Cafeccino, there is an airstream trailer that has been converted into an ice cream stand. This is where Nilla Vanille owns and operates the making of Inkopolis's creamiest concoctions. Thanks to her fathers Rocky and Rhodes, she has positioned the stand in a prime location: in front of the cafe, where her treats pair perfectly with the drinks to be found inside, and a short walk from where weary gauntlet runners can celebrate victories and soften losses with a delicious ice cream. She is always experimenting with inventing new flavors, and much of her extra income is spent in the form of donations to (????), of which she is very vocal about. 

### Kerplunk 
> Tucked away in an alley down the concrete stairs sits Kerplunk. Wayward souls and tired commuters stop by to drown away their sorrows in alcoholic ecstasy. The wild, the angry, the bitter, all gathered in one place like a perverted symphony. [[Corsair]], the bartender, reveled in the chaos. This fast talking, wise cracking woman has a penchant for trouble, and welcomes it with open (fire)arms. Those with more dubious intentions sought out Kerplunk’s secret menu: brandy with a side of…illegal weaponry!?

## Esterra
- *The Remnants of God's Wrath*

> [[Esterra Notes]] is a city located inside a deep canyon. Esterra and Cirrane have a history rife with fighting over resources. As resources began to diminish within the small nation, however, Esterra decided to enter into a tentative treaty with Cirrane and end all disputes. The treaty turned a formerly closed border nation into one open to tourism.
