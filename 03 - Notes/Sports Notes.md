1. All players wear some type of sensor that functions as their "flag". Sensors are located on the chest, back, and arms (shoulders?). They also wear gloves that sync with the sensors. The gloves help the sensors know if a player has been tagged and to freeze them in place, until they are unfrozen. Lights on sensors will be on when a player is unfrozen/in play and off when they are frozen/out of play.,
2. Points are assigned to each player. We can refine the point system later but for now I'll use the old one we had. Captains have 10 points, and normal players have 5. When a player is tagged/frozen they lose their points. Captains can return points to their teammates, but if a captain is frozen then it will take 2-3 players to get their points back.,
3. Points will rise and fall as players on both sides lose and regain their flags. Final scores will not be tallied until the end of the match. _The only exception to this would be if all players on a single team lose their points in a total wipe out._ If this happens the match is immediately ended.,
4. Battle Royale - I think there should be a battle royale element to the sport where the stage becomes gradually smaller to force interactions among players. That being said, as space shrinks any frozen players caught out of bounds for any reason will be permanently out of the match and their points locked with the opposing team.,
5. Players that lost points are frozen in place until they are tagged back in by their captain. This gives way to strategies where someone might use them to lure captains out for bigger points.

sensors work via body magic to freeze players in place until their released by a teammate/their captain
