## Introduction
---
Fire is an element known to burn bright. It is not easy to contain, but with the right touch, fire can be warm and inviting. It can provide light in even the darkest places. Fire hungers for freedom. Too much freedom, however, and fire will consume everything in its path, but too little may cause it to lash out in unexpected ways. Fire affinities demand respect, but do not freely give it. They are known for having explosive personalities, but are passionate lovers, and loyal to those who have earned it.
