>> ## Introduction
>> ---
>> Mind is not ruled by emotion. It is methodical and takes time to assess a situation before acting or reacting. It does not often jump to conclusions or make decisions based on a feeling. The mind is a sponge and hungers for knowledge. It learns and grows and is ever expanding on the understanding of human nature and the world at large.
