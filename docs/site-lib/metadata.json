Tequila gathered intel on Kiwi for the first interview.\nTequlia conducts background checks on all press coverage to insure there are no bad actors.\nAll people who interact with the governor are kept on file. Morelle moves to Cirrane a few years after Kiwi's departure. Got bored of her work life and wanted something new. Held hope that maybe Kiwi is in Cirrane somewhere.\nCouldn't find him because Cirrane is so huge and foreign to her. Ethereal Shadows gains traction in the sports scene. big time Kiwi reconnects with Morelle everything is sunshine and roses and happy times\nKenny is pouty because Morelle is spending all her time with Kiwi. Kiwi tells Morelle about the book he wants to write. It's a good chance for him to build his portfolio and get his name out there. Kiwi starts the interviewing Tequila. Tequila starts asking questions about Kiwi after interview sessions.\nKiwi is not comfortable with talking about his past because he defected from the Esterran army and he may be forced to return.\nTequila promises nothing will happen to him and offers him a job.\nHe reluctantly accepts after some hemming and hawing. He asks for information about the crystals.\nShe promises to give clearance, but it will take a while. Morelle and Kiwi are concerned about Tequila Why does she know that Kiwi defected from the army?\nWhy bring it up?\nWhat does she plan to do with that information. Tims are subservient to Kiwi and help him feel welcomed in his new office. They drive him crazy\nHe hates them\nOh my god. Martini comes in and calls Kiwi \"Tim\". He hates it.\nMentions it to Tequila. Martini is summoned to Tequila's office Tequila tells Martini to treat Kiwi with respect\nMartini is annoyed about it but she goes along with it After a few weeks of working, Kiwi feels someone attempting to read his mind. Mind affinities can only read the thoughts of someone nearby. A room away at maximum The only people who cross paths with him frequently are the Tims.\nMartini could also be a possibility.\nTequila, who's a mind vessel, is able to hone in on people at longer distances.\nShe uses Martini to manipulate Kiwi's feelings and make him feel safe.\nShe's surprised Kiwi is able to keep her out, it's not often that people can do that.\nShe becomes interested in him.\nThis happens off and on for a few weeks. Kiwi comes home and tells Morelle about what happened. The two of them are concerned.\nMorelle suggests he reports on it. Kiwi reports to Tequila that someone is reading his mind That's a big security concern.\nShe says they will investigate and narrow down who's responsible.\nTequila sends Lima to give Kiwi papers.\nKiwi feels someone getting into his head again. At a later date, Lima passes Kiwi's room. Kiwi feels someone in his head.\nHe starts to think it's Lima.\nTequila picks up on this. Kiwi goes to the cafe where Lima is nearby. Someone is in his head again.\nOutside of work.\nHe tells Morelle he's certain it's Lima.\nNeither of them know Lima's affinity. Trinity Affinities are subtle and harder to notice. He could be a mind affinity...right? They don't have hard proof though... Kiwi tells Tequila that he thinks Lima is behind it.\nShe says they will look into it.\nLima is gone from that point on.\nKiwi still feels someone getting into his head outside of work though...\nHe starts avoiding Cafeccino Tequila \"fires\" Lima Says he's making Kiwi uncomfortable.\nShe's moving him downstairs.\nHe's like \"Uh why? What the hell?\" but just goes with it. Tequila amps up Kiwi's workload More meetings\nMore paperworks\nMore articles\nThis happens gradually over time.\nPress Journalist was fired, Kiwi takes over the job It's articles about magical shipments. Keeps promising him clearance. Kiwi starts working overtime. Stays after work\nComes home late\nFeels burnt out all the time\nSome days he can't remember what he did\netc Morelle becomes concerned for Kiwi's wellbeing and suggests he takes time off Kiwi refuses the first time\nKiwi falls asleep at the desk Tequila calls his emergency contact (Morelle) and requests that she picks him up.\nMorelle tells Kiwi to please take time off\nKiwi finally accepts and ask Tequila for time off\nTequila agrees. He can't work his best if hes not well rested.\nShe's so nice :) Kiwi takes a break and comes back to work with a fresh mind But workload never ceases.\nThere's even MORE work to be done. Lima is engineering something that can be used to make workers more complicit Puts a mental block\nblock memories and certain emotions\nStruggling to get it right\nWants Tequila's approval\nBut also doesnt want to complete the project because what if she uses it against him?\nTries to design something to counteract it so he can protect himself and Rita\n??? The experiment backfires Messes with Kiwi\nCreates gaps in his memory\nTequila upset that Lima is messing up her project\nTells him to fix it\nHe's given a short amount of time to fix it The experiment backfires again in a worse way Kiwi passes out at work\nHe's seemingly unresponsive Tequila tells lima that if he can't be useful as an engineer then he can at least show his worth as a soldier\nHas him train for assassin work instead\nthen asked with attacking the cafe\nif he's trained correctly, he should have no qualms about killing people he knows Kiwi lands in the hospital for a day or two Tequila tells him to take two weeks off\nMorelle wants Kiwi to quit\nKiwi puts in his two weeks notice upon returning to work\nTequila saids thats a shame because his clearance was almost ready It wasnt but she gets Martini to accelerate the process Kiwi can't resist knowledge, he stays His clearance comes through in two weeks\nMorelle is worried.......

Earth Religion A belief that all things return to the earth and it should be honored\nTraditional prayer involves incense and candles, they burn sage to cleanse areas such as new homes/businesses/etc. Esterrans have a day where they celebrate the dead Lanterns with letters, prayers and pictures are sent into the sky to be gifted to their departed loved ones.\nThe holiday is always on a the second moon's full moon (idk which month yet) Should be during fall/autumn when the veil between the land of the living and dead is at its thinnest Mourning the Dead Private prayers are written on paper and burned so the embers can carry their messages to the dead\nAll things return to earth Esterrans believe that all things return to the earth, the living included. Their funerals are centered around this belief. When a person dies, their body is returned to the earth from which it came. The body is placed in a bed of flowers where it will remain until moving on to its final resting place. A family member will be tasked with traveling to the lake to retrieve a Lily of the Moon. The lily is believed to contain the essence of the dead who will help guide their loved one into the afterlife. After the funeral, the body will be moved to a botanical cemetery (found throughout Esterra) where it will then stay until they have returned to the earth (become compost), at which point the soil will be collected and sent down to the lake to fertilize the Lily of the Moon. Thus the cycle repeats itself! Keepers of the Lily Organization tasked with maintaining the Lily of the Moon and assisting with its cultivation and growth\nKeepers of the Lily are exclusively soul affinities, to be chosen as one of them is viewed as a great honor\nThey live at the lake and dedicate their lives to the lily It's located in a giant crater created by Gaia during the great calamity\nBuildings line the rim and spiral deeper into the crater.\nA lake sits at the bottom Folklore about a monster!?\nThere's a purification center that provides water for the citizens\nHome to the Lily of the Moon - Special flower that can only grow along the lake The deepest part of the crater is dangerous Need equipment to safely traverse\nUneven terrain\nSlippery terrain\nToxic gases\nA m-m-monster!?\nDrowning\nLow oxygen More of a problem in small tunnels and enclosures The lowest inhabitable zone Ventilation\nWater is filtered, but not perfect\nHome of most mining operations Esterra's military was born about from a need to gain independence from Cirrane.
