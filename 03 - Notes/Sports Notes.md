- Flags
	- Refers to the sensors worn by all gauntlet runners. 
	- The flags function as the points for a given player during the match. 
	- If a flag is tagged, the player becomes frozen in place and they lose their points until they can be retrieved by the team's captain. 
		- If a captain is captured they can only be freed with the help of 2-3 other players. 
	- Along with the sensors, players are requires to wear specialized gloves that sync with the sensors and help determine when someone has been tagged. 
	- Body magic inside the sensors freezes players in place until they can be unfrozen.

	- special outfits

- Weaponry

	- Note: When deciding on which weapons to allow in the sport, they need to be weapons with the intent to hit the sensors/flags. Weapons specifically/only designed to injure should not be considered. 

## Leagues

	- Team rankings are determined by the points they earn in each match. The more matches they play in the more points they earn. 
	- Many tournaments take place throughout a given season, though there are 7 major tournaments (known as the Big 7) that the top teams of the league usually compete in. There are also smaller tournaments.
		- Larger tournaments generally have more rounds so more potential for points, whereas smaller tournaments might not have the strongest players but can end up being easy points for teams
	- The season begins in May and ends in November
		- Dragon's Gauntlet is the final of the season and takes place in the Horizon District during the Dragon's Festival
	- Tournament brackets are not determined prior to the start of the tournament. Instead teams are put in a "last man standing free-for-all" with brackets being determined based on what place each team comes in.
