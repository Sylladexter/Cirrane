## Introduction
---
The body is ruled by instinct. It does whatever feels right in the moment and almost never puts much thought into decisions. Those with a body affinity are said to have great strength but also sharp reflexes. They are very in tune with their bodies and sometimes stretch the limits on what the human body can actually do.
