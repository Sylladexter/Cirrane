## Introduction

Fire is an element known to burn bright. It is not easy to contain, but with the right touch, fire can be warm and inviting. It can provide light in even the darkest places. Fire hungers for freedom. Too much freedom, however, and fire will consume everything in its path, but too little may cause it to lash out in unexpected ways. Fire affinities demand respect, but do not freely give it. They are known for having explosive personalities, but are passionate lovers, and loyal to those who have earned it.

## PELE
######  The Phoenix 
----
### Personality

Pele is known to be a god of destruction who burns everything in his wake. His fury knows no limits, and those who invoke it are said to be reduced to ash. Pele's rage is said to be explosive when triggered, though he has just as often been known to simmer and fan the flames until the moment strikes. 

His kindness is warm and gentle, inviting those in need into the fire's embrace. Pele can be vain and, like the sun, wishes for the universe to revolve around him. It takes a skilled hand to wrangle this god and keep him pleased. 

He is petty and loves nothing more than watching foes squirm., or to burn them to a crisp, whichever fits his mood that day.

Pele has a known feud with Pavana that extends even to their vessels.

### Relationship with Vessel

Those that devote themselves fully to Pele are said to receive the powers of the sun. They will earn the loyalty of a god as deeply devoted to them as they are to him. He would burn entire cities to the ground to protect the vessel he holds most dear.

Pele takes the choosing of a vessel very seriously and only bestows such an honor to the most worthy of humans. A god that burns as bright as the sun deserves a vessel that can match that energy. Pele seeks out those that forge their own paths and can't be easily contained. Those that can stand on their own and burn all who earn their ire.

He fans the flames of their passions and sets fire to their greatest foes.

Vessels of Pele must take caution for even the largest start in the sky will eventually burn out.

*"Rise from the ashes, little fledgling, with a burning passion and incinerate your foes to nothing. Show them the true might of the phoenix."*

### Known Abilities
