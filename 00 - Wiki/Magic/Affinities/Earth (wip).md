## Introduction
---
Earth affinities are said to be the most in tune with nature given that their element is nature itself. Plants appear to spring to life whenever they are nearby and they make for steadfast, loyal relationships. Unlike air which is known for being up in the clouds, earth is more grounded in reality. They do not bend easily to pressure and are well known for being hard headed.
