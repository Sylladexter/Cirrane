## Introduction
---
Air is a cool breeze on a warm summer day. It’s the heat rising from a bonfire that carries smoke into the sky. Air is a biting cold atop the mountain’s peak. It falls and rises, and never stops moving. Those with an air affinity are thought to be travelers, never staying in one place for long. They wander the earth, experiencing all life has to offer, and go wherever their whim dictates. Air affinities are said to have their head in the clouds, thoughts scattering with the breeze. Don’t be fooled, however, as air affinities can be just as sharp and cutting as a storm’s gale.

## Personality
---
Air is an element that is always on the move. It goes wherever it pleases and can't be stopped. Air affinities are believed to embody these traits. They are known for being agile, fast, and light on their feet. Said to be flighty, air affinities follow their whims and do as they desire. 

Take care when forming relationships with air affinities to not get swept up in their current. They can be kind and gentle like a breeze or harsh and biting like the strongest gales. Air affinities do not mince their words and often say things that cut deep whether they mean it or not. Much like their god, Pavana, air affinities are known for holding grudges and acting out of spite. They can be petty and childish when situations demand it, but are generally known for keeping a cool head.

People born under this affinity are known for their luck.
