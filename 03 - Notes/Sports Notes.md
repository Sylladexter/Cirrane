1. All players wear some type of sensor that functions as their "flag". Sensors are located on the chest, back, and arms (shoulders?). They also wear gloves that sync with the sensors. The gloves help the sensors know if a player has been tagged and to freeze them in place, until they are unfrozen. Lights on sensors will be on when a player is unfrozen/in play and off when they are frozen/out of play.,
2. Points are assigned to each player. We can refine the point system later but for now I'll use the old one we had. Captains have 10 points, and normal players have 5. When a player is tagged/frozen they lose their points. Captains can return points to their teammates, but if a captain is frozen then it will take 2-3 players to get their points back.,
3. Points will rise and fall as players on both sides lose and regain their flags. Final scores will not be tallied until the end of the match. _The only exception to this would be if all players on a single team lose their points in a total wipe out._ If this happens the match is immediately ended.,
4. Battle Royale - I think there should be a battle royale element to the sport where the stage becomes gradually smaller to force interactions among players. That being said, as space shrinks any frozen players caught out of bounds for any reason will be permanently out of the match and their points locked with the opposing team.,
5. Players that lost points are frozen in place until they are tagged back in by their captain. This gives way to strategies where someone might use them to lure captains out for bigger points.

sensors work via body magic to freeze players in place until their released by a teammate/their captain

## The Gauntlet
- The major sport of Cirrane. The Gauntlet is a sport mixed up of freeze tag, capture the flag, and a battle royale. 
- The goal is to have the most by the the end of the match. 
- Players of the sport are known as gauntlet runners or just runners. 
- Start in Cirrane as a way to honor the gods, it has evolved over the years to be less of a blood sport but still carries many risks to runners.

- Flags
	- Refers to the sensors worn by all gauntlet runners. 
	- The flags function as the points for a given player during the match. 
	- If a flag is tagged, the player becomes frozen in place and they lose their points until they can be retrieved by the team's captain. 
		- If a captain is captured they can only be freed with the help of 2-3 other players. 
	- Along with the sensors, players are requires to wear specialized gloves that sync with the sensors and help determine when someone has been tagged. 
	- Body magic inside the sensors freezes players in place until they can be unfrozen.

## Point System
- Figure out Point System
	Maximum number of points a team can have? Minimum? 
	How many points to captains have vs normal players?
- Each player is assigned a set number of points with captain holding the most amount of points at the start of a match.
	- Points can be stolen from the opponent, and taken back by the team's captain.
- If a player loses their points and then falls out of bounds, those points are locked with the opponent and can't be stolen back as the player associated with them is out of the match.
- Points will rise and fall throughout a match as players lose and regain points. A final tally will be done at the end of the match to determine who the winner is.
- Matches have a running scoreboard tracking players' progress during the match.
- In the event that a team is completely wiped in a match (all points are lost), the match will end immediately and the opposing team declared victorious.
